# FSND-Neighborhood-Map

This is the 5th project of the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree. It is an interactive map of my neighborhood that uses the Google Maps API as well as the Foursquare API to show locations and information about those locations around town.

All functionality is included within the scripts, the only software needed to run is a web browser of some kind. 

To run, download the repo and run the index.html file. 
Once it is running, the search bar in the upper righthand corner will allow the user to filter the locations by name
the user can either click on the markers themselves or on the list of location names on the left to show the information for that location.
